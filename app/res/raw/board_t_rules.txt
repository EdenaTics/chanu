<h3>/t/ - Torrents</h3>

<p>1. All material licensed in the United States is prohibited. This includes music, manga, hentai, artbooks, and anything else protected by United States copyright law. (Note: 99% of what you will find on the internet is probably unlicensed, however first check and make sure it is before posting!)</p>
<p>2. There will be no "warez" allowed. Warez is classified as: retail software, games, movies, etc. See the above rule.</p>
<p>3. Content should be Japanese in theme or origin. The torrents board is not your standard anime tracker. As such, no anime of any kind is to be posted on this board.</p>
<p>4. Threads should not consist of filedump links. <em>Replying</em> to a pre-existing thread with RapidShare/Putfile/Megaupload/YouTube links is allowed, so long as the original post contains a torrent.  Check out <a href="http://rs.4chan.org/">http://rs.4chan.org/</a> for these types of links.</p>
