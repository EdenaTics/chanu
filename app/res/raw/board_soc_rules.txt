<h3>/soc/ - Social</h3>

<p>1. Created to get "rate me," meetup, report in, and camwhore threads out of /b/ and /r9k/.</p>
<p>2. No whining (aka "BAWWW") or "life" threads. This is not your personal blog.</p>
<p>3. Tinychat and Amazon wishlist/begging threads are not allowed.</p>
<p>4. Soliciting or offering payments for photos, webcam shows, etc is not allowed.</p>
<p>5. Do not stalk or harass any users. Be civil to camwhores.</p>
<p>6. Requesting contact info outside of contact and meetup threads is not allowed. If a user wishes to provide contact info on their own, they are free to do so, but all requests will be deleted.</p>
<p>7. Asking a user to write on a sign is not allowed, unless said user is actively taking requests.  Timestamp requests are permitted.</p>
<p>8. Please try to keep duplicate topics to a minimum by always searching for an old or active thread before posting a new one. Do not post a continuation of a thread until the bump limit is reached.</p>
