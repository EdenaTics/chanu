<h3>/jp/ - Otaku Culture</h3>

<p>1. All images and discussion should pertain to light and visual novels, figures and other otaku paraphernalia, Touhou Project, Vocaloid, doujin works and music, NEET lifestyle, and diverse niche Japanese interests (kigurumi, idols, mahjong, tea).</p>
<p>2. This is the appropriate board for the discussion of Japanese visual novels, and light novels without an animated adaptation. Western visual novels should be posted to /vg/, and translated visual novels are fine on either board.</p>
