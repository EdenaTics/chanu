<h3>/hr/ - High Resolution</h3>

<p>1. Post <em>quality</em> high-resolution 2D/3D artwork, scans, photography, and images of interest here.</p>
<p>2. Do not simply post images because they have large dimensions. If an image would be of interest to another board, please crosspost the image (resizing if necessary).</p>
<p>3. The <em>high resolution</em> board was created to provide a venue for extremely large images. It is not intended to be a <em>random</em> board.</p>
<p>4. Non-worksafe images are allowed, however content must be kept tasteful (no grossout images).</p>
